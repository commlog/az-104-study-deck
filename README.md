<h1>AZ-104 Study Deck</h1>

<p>This repository contains an Anki deck of just under 4,000 multiple-choice questions designed to help with studying for the AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator exam. The questions are based on content available on Microsoft Learn and are organized to cover key areas youâ€™ll need to know for the exam.</p>

<h2>About the Deck</h2>

<p>The deck was created using a custom-made Anki note type tailored specifically for AZ-104 content, making it easier to review and retain information. I consolidated information from Microsoft Learn modules into comprehensive, exam-focused questions. I had a little assistance from AI to generate or refine questions, ensuring they align well with AZ-104 material.</p>
